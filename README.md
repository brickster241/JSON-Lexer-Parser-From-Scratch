# JSON Lexer + Parser from Scratch

This project is a complete **JSON Lexer and Parser** written from scratch in Python. It takes raw JSON strings, tokenizes them into meaningful syntactic units, and parses them into **Python-native ASTs** using recursive descent logic. Will return whether the given string is a valid JSON or not.

Unlike typical off-the-shelf parsers, this solution breaks down every character and builds up the structure manually, mimicking how real interpreters work ‚Äî providing clarity, control, and deep insight into how JSON syntax is understood and validated.

This project is a superset of the solution to the [Build-Your-Own-JSON-Parser](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser) on Coding Challenges by John Crickett.

## üöÄ Features :

- **Complete Lexer + Tokenizer**  : Built a robust Lexer that can tokenize full JSON strings into custom `Token` objects, tracking nesting levels, escape characters, and quote states accurately for both readability and downstream parsing.

- **Recursive Descent Parser**  : Designed a clean and modular parser using recursive descent methods to parse complex JSON into correct Python **lists** and **dictionaries** ‚Äî fully conforming to JSON standards as per [https://www.json.org/json-en.html].

- **Performance and Accuracy**  : Achieved **100% accuracy** on a rigorous test suite: Processed **50+ test cases**, Covering **500,000+ tokens** and validated against real-world JSON structures and edge cases.

- **Color-coded Token Output**  : Lexer displays token types with ANSI colors in terminal for enhanced debugging and visualization of the lexing process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Running Program

Follow these simple steps to run the JSON Lexer + Parser on your machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brickster241/JSON-Lexer-Parser-From-Scratch.git
cd JSON-Lexer-Parser-From-Scratch
```

### 2. Run the Program

You can run the program with existing test suite :

```bash
python .\src\main.py
```

Or modify/add json files in `tests` folder with your own custom input string.
